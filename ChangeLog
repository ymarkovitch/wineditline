MinGWEditLine's ChangeLog
-------------------------

*** June 19, 2012: release of MinGWEditLine 2.06 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Improved redraw performance when dealing with large command
    lines
  - Fixed a potential buffer overflow issue in displaying long
    history lines
  - Fixed an issue which might arise in certain cases when using
    CTRL+W (delete-word)
  - Switched from autotools to standard makefiles for 32/64-bit
    platforms
  - Added test programs which can be built by "make test"
  - In addition to the static library now a DLL is also built
    (thanks to Tim Hudson at CryptSoft for the useful discussion)
  - Most common emacs key bindings are now supported (again, thanks
    to Tim Hudson for the suggestion)


*** June 13, 2012: release of MinGWEditLine 2.04 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Fixed a number of issues which might arise using console windows
    with different screen buffer sizes
  - Fixed an issue connected with pasting UNIX-encoded clipboard
    contents


*** June 4, 2012: release of MinGWEditLine 2.02 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Added synchronization between wide-char and multibyte strings in
    _el_insert_char() and _el_delete_char() to avoid potential issues
    with custom completing functions or signal handling functions


*** June 2, 2012: release of MinGWEditLine 2.01 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Support for rl_basic_word_break_characters[] and
    rl_completer_word_break_characters[] variables
  - Better handling of CTRL+C events (if the current line is not
    empty the function returns an empty string, otherwise CTRL+C is
    not intercepted)
  - MinGWEditLine does not crash anymore if a program omits calling
    using_history() before calling history-related functions
  - The prototype of readline() has been corrected to match
    GNU Readline's and EditLine's readline() prototypes
  - Minor bugfixes


*** May 21, 2012: release of MinGWEditLine 2.0 ***
