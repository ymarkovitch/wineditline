Installation Instructions
-------------------------

To build and install MinGWEditLine, do the following from a
MSYS/MinGW shell:

$ cd src
$ make install

Issuing the command

$ make test

will build libedit_test.exe and libedit_test_dll.exe, which can be
used to verify that that both static and shared libedit versions have
been built and work correctly.

You may select the path to the compiler as well as where header files
and libraries will be installed editing the makefile; sample
makefiles are provided for both 32-bit and 64-bit MinGW-w64
installations.

Pre-built static and shared libraries are provided for both 32 and
64-bit Windows in the lib32, lib64, bin32, bin64 folders.
