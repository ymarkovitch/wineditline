Installation Instructions
-------------------------

To build and install MinGWEditLine, do the following from a
MSYS/MinGW shell:

$ cd src
$ make install

Issuing the command

$ make test

will build libedit_test.exe and libedit_test_dll.exe, which can be
used to verify that that both static and shared libedit versions have
been built and work correctly. libedit_test_dll.c is a nice, portable
example contributed by Tim Hudson which shows how to build programs
without introducing an explicit dependency from libedit: if the
libedit shared library is installed in the system, then it will be
loaded at runtime and used, otherwise the calling program will
fall back on standard fgets(). libedit_test.c is a standard example
of static linking against libedit.a.

You may select the path to the compiler as well as where header files
and libraries will be installed editing the makefile; sample
makefiles are provided for both 32-bit and 64-bit MinGW-w64
installations.

Pre-built static and shared libraries are provided for both 32 and
64-bit Windows in the lib32, lib64, bin32, bin64 folders.
